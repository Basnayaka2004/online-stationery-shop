## How to Add Your Logo

To add your logo to the website, simply place your logo file in this folder with one of the following names:

- `logo.png` (recommended - supports transparency)
- `logo.jpg` 
- `logo.svg` (vector - best for scaling)

## Logo Guidelines

- **Recommended Size**: 200px height (width will auto-scale)
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background is best
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or horizontal logos work best
